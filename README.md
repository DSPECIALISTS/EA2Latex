# EA2Latex

EA2Latex enhances Enterprise Architect with advanced document generaration features to support the model driven specification work flow. EA2Latex generates ready to release specification documents from your EA model which require no further tweaking.

EA2Latex was started as an internal tool at [DSPECIALISTS](http://www.dspecialists.com) and has been presented at the Embedded World Conference 2016 in Nuremberg where it received public interest.

## Architecture

EA2Latex uses a client/server architecture:
 * EA2Latex Addin: The Enterprise Architect extension module
 * Build Server: Server based LaTeX Build-Environment which is triggered by the Addin to complete document generation.
 
The server based approach has been chosen to easily provide all members of a team with the same build environment and to reduce the need of client updates.

## Documentation

All current documentation is written in German language but will be translated to English upon request. As for now Google translate does a decent job for those who can't wait for the translation.

See [EA2Latex_Handbuch.pdf](Documentation/EA2Latex_Handbuch/EA2Latex_Handbuch.pdf) for the latest User Manual.
